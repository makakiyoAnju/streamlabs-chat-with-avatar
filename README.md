# Streamlabs - Chat with Avatars
Custom HTML/CSS/JS to have Twitch profile pic showing alongside with chat messages of the Chat box widget

## Instructions

###### Getting your Client ID
Before you do anything, you want to make your own client application by going to [https://dev.twitch.tv/](https://dev.twitch.tv/) and logging with your Twitch account. This is important as you need to get a client ID from it. Once you are logged in, go to "Your Console" and click on the "Applications" tab. There will be a button "Register an Application". You can put whatever you want in the "Name". The most important input you need to do is the OAuth Redirect URLs. In the Redirect URLs, you want to put and then add: `https://twitchapps.com/tokengen/`. Once added, make sure you hit save. Now you want to copy the Client ID and paste it into the "clientId" of the JS coding (it'll say `{Your Client ID here}`).

###### Setting up the Custom Chat
Go to your [Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com/) dashboard > All Widgets > Chat Box (or Streamlabs Desktop/SLOBS Chat Box widget) <br />
Find `Enable Custom HTML/CSS` and have "Enabled" selected <br />
Here you will paste the codes in the HTML, CSS, and JS <br />
